<span id="Welcome to Ian's Webpage (Under construction)-Projects-Chemotaxis Simulation CLI Tool (Python)"></span><strong id="Chemotaxis Simulation CLI Tool (Python)">Chemotaxis Simulation CLI Tool (Python)</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Python project as part of my ongoing research that simulates a

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
chemotaxis process from a parabollic-elliptic system of differential
equations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Central differences and the Runge-Kutta numerical method were used to

</ul>
<p>
improve the accuracy of the simulations while ghost points were used to treat the Neumann boundary conditions
accurately.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The simulations match theoretical results previously known, and we expect to find new properties of the solutions in our ongoing research.

</ul>

<span id="Welcome to Ian's Webpage (Under construction)-Projects-Simulations on Some Surface Growth Models (Python)"></span><strong id="Simulations on Some Surface Growth Models (Python)">Simulations on Some Surface Growth Models (Python)</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Project developed for the Applied Stochastic Processes course to

</ul>
<p>
simulate a ballistic deposition model.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We could corroborate through our simulations that the growth model

</ul>
<p>
belongs to the universality class such as the one exhibit by the
fluctuations of the KPZ equation. Indeed, different ballistic depositions of tetrominoes led to the same universality class of
fluctuations.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Although the empirical results corresponded with the expected behaviour,

</ul>
<p>
we could not provide a theoretical proof of the specific region where the
fluctuation behaved as the ones of the KPZ equation due to the randomness of
the fluctuation paths.

<span id="Welcome to Ian's Webpage (Under construction)-Projects-Chicken Behaviour via Markov Chains (Python)"></span><strong id="Chicken Behaviour via Markov Chains (Python)">Chicken Behaviour via Markov Chains (Python)</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Project developed for the Applied Stochastic Processes course to analize

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
the behaviour of chickens from a real dataset provided by a Poultry Sciences
graduate student.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
By analizing the behavioral data we were able to identify the

</ul>
<p>
significant and often ocurring sequential behavioral patterns which led us to find the stationary distribution of the Markov chain
associated to the chickens' actions.

<ul>
<li>
Thesis for the B. S. in Mathematics in which a self-adjoint

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Sturm-Liouville problem contains a coefficient whose Fourier series is a
lacunary sequence.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We proved that the solution of the Sturm-Liouville problem has equally

</ul>
<p>
spaced Fourier coefficients given by the lacunary sequence of the
problem.
